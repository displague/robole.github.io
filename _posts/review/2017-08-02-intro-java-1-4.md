# Relational Operators (Objective 7.6)
-	Relational operators always result in a boolean value
-	There are six relational operators: ```>```, ```>=```, ```<```, ```<=```, ```==```, and ```!=```. The last two (```==```
and ```!=```) are sometimes referred to as equality operators.

-	There are actually 11 or so compound assignment operators, but only the four most commonly used are: ```+=```, ```-=```, ```*=```, and ```/=``` e.g.

```java
x -= y; //same as x = x – y;
```
-	The operator precedence for compound operators is slightly different than you might expect, the right side is always evaluated first.

```java
x *= 2 + 5; //evaluated as x = x * (2 + 5)
```
-	Think of it as putting the right-side in parenthesis, then remove the equals sign to get the equation!

-	When comparing characters, Java compares the numerical Unicode values.

-	Four types of things can be tested using the equality operators: numbers, characters, booleans, and reference variables.

-	When comparing reference variables, ```==``` returns true only if both reference variables refer to the same object.
-	```==``` gives a compiler error if the operands are cast-incompatible (BUT all numeric primitives including char can be compared with ```==```).

# instanceof Operator (Objective 7.6)
-	```instanceof``` can be used on reference variables only. It checks whether the object is of a particular type.
-	The ```instanceof``` operator can only be used only to test objects (or ```null```) against class types of which they are in the same class hierarchy.

```java
interface Vessel{}
interface Toy{} //not implemented
class Boat implements Vessel { }
class Speedboat extends Boat{ }
class Dingy extends Speedboat{}

public class Test{
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
			Boat b = new Boat();
			if(b instanceof Boat)
				System.out.println("b is a Boat"); //true
			if(b instanceof Vessel)
				System.out.println("b is a Vessel"); //true
			if(b instanceof Toy)
				System.out.println("b is a Toy"); //false
			if(b instanceof Dingy)
				System.out.println("b is a Dingy"); //false

			Dingy d = new Dingy();
			if( d instanceof Boat)
				System.out.println("d is a Boat");//false
			if( null instanceof Boat)
				System.out.println("null is a Boat"); //false
			if(d instanceof MyClass) //compiler error
	   }	   
}
```

-	If you test an object reference against a class using ```instanceof``` that is NOT in it’s class hierarchy, it will result in a compiler error.
-	If you compare an object reference to an unrelated interface, or an interface reference to a class, there will be NO compiler error.

-	For interfaces, an object passes the instanceof test if any of its superclasses implement the interface on the right side of the instanceof operator.

# Arithmetic Operators (Objective 7.6)
-	There are four primary math operators: add ```+```, subtract ```-```, multiply ```*```, and divide ```/```.
-	The modulus operator(```%```) returns the remainder from a division operation.

-	The ```*```, ```/```, and ``` %``` operators have higher precedence than + and -.

-	Expressions are evaluated from left to right
-	Evaluation of an expression is changed if you add parentheses, or use operators in the expression that have higher precedence than others. e.g.

```java
int a = 4 + 5 * 6; //a = 34
int a = (4 + 5) * 6 ; //a = 54
```

# String Concatenation Operator (Objective 7.6)

-	If either operand is a ```String```, ```+``` concatenates the operands.
-	If both operands are numeric, ```+``` adds the operands.

```java
int x = 42;
int y = 44;
System.out.println(x + y + “text”); //prints: 86text
```

# Increment/Decrement Operators (Objective 7.6)

-	Prefix operators (```++``` and ```--```) run before the value is used in the expression.

```java
static int players = 0;
System.out.println("value of players: " + ++players);

//Prints: value of players: 1
```

-	Postfix operators (```++``` and ```--```) run after the value is used in the expression.

```java
static int players = 0;
System.out.println("value of players: " + players++);

//Prints: value of players: 0
```

# Ternary (Conditional Operator) (Objective 7.6)
-	*Condition ? Expression if true: Expression if false;*

```java
int numOfPets = 3;
String status = (numOfPets < 4) ? "Pet limit not exceeded": "too many pets";
System.out.println(status); //Prints: Pet limit not exceeded
```

# Bitwise Operators
You should merely be aware that the following are bitwise operators:
```&```, ```|```, ```^```,``` ~```, ```<<```, ```>>```, ```>>>``` .

# Logical Operators (Objective 7.6)
-	The exam covers six "logical" operators:
``` &```, ```|```, ```^```, ```!```, ```&&```, and ```||```.

-	Logical operators work with two expressions (except for ```!```) that must resolve to boolean values.

-	The ```&&``` and ```&``` operators return true only if both operands are true.
-	 The
```||``` and ```|``` operators return true if either or both operands are true.

-	The ```&&``` and
``` || ``` operators are known as short-circuit operators, they do not waste their time evaluating both expressions if it knows the result of the complete expression from the evaluation of the first expression:
    -	If the left operand is false, the ```&&``` operator does NOT evaluate the right operand.
    -	If the left operand is true, the
    ```|| ``` does NOT evaluate the right operand.

```java
int z = 5;
if(++z > 5 || ++z > 6){
	z++;
}  
// z = 7 now
```

-	```^``` (called the "logical XOR" operator) returns true if exactly one operand
is true.

-	```!``` (called the "inversion" operator) returns the opposite value of the boolean operand it precedes.
