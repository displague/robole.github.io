## Patterns of Analysis: Prefer Relative to (instead of) Absolute

A number without context does not mean much. - Absolute  

A number compared to another is already meaning something - Relative

A trend is a “relative” calculation, example: traffic in the site has grown 10% last month - this is doing the relative comparison of the absolute numbers of 2 months. The absolute numbers alone give less insight.

Another advantage is with sampling, notice that in example above, “growth is 10%” could have be calculated over a sample or on absolute value, on occasion we in fact don’t have absolute values available to use.  

**Working with samples**  
In general when working with sampled data is better to keep calculations in the **relative** world, and avoid when possible projecting to the absolute total number. 

This is especially important when we have doubts on the accuracy of the sampling, i.e 10% sampling could be more like 8% for example.
