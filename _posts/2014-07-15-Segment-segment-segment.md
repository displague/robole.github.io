## Patterns of analysis: Segment, segment, segment

**Typical day:**  

> Calculate a rate ( sales / traffic )

Looks low, I thought it was higher wonder how has it been changing?

> Plot a rate over time (trend pattern)

Oh, I see a huge drop this week, what up with that ?  

> Segment: create 2 separate charts, one with the trend of sales and other with trend of traffic

Oh the trend of traffic had a huge jump this week, so looks like we are getting loads more traffic that are not making a purchase.  
Realize we’ve launched a mail marketing campaign this week sent to millions of users

> That explains it, loads people got an email they came to see what’s up, not as many are interested and leave (bounce).

**Method**

When puzzling over why data is looking like it does, is a good idea to segment (a lot) it further to pin point exactly the data point, or variable that is influencing the top level change we are seeing.
