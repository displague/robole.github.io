The Java Persistence API (JPA) is an industry specification for persisting data between objects and a database. It was introduced to help form a standard with the emergence of different and divergent Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks. The JPA 2.1 specification was released 22 April 2013, JPA 2.2 is a maintenance release that was approved on 19 June 2017.

Most of the persistence vendors support JPA:
- [Hibernate (latest v5.2 supporting JPA 2.1)](http://hibernate.org/orm/)
- [EclipseLink (latest v2.4 supports some of JPA 2.1)](http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/)
- [Apache OpenJPA (v2.4.1 supporting JPA 2.0, v3.x under development to support JPA 2.1)](https://openjpa.apache.org/)

# Features

- Object-relational mappings can be done through annotations, or in XML.
-JPA defines a runtime EntityManager API for processing queries and transaction on the objects against the database.
- JPA defines an object-level query language, JPQL, to allow querying of the objects from the database.

# How?

## 1. Create an entity class

The entity object is nothing but a POJO class marked as an entity with the @Entity annotation.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="TRADES")
    public class Trade {
    @Column( nullable=false)
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int id = 0;
    @Column
    private String direction = null;
    @Column
    private String account = null;
    ...

The mappings are done through JPA Annotations here, but can done through a configuration file called orm.xml also.

There are a few points to keep in mind when creating an entity class:

- The entity class should have a default no-argument constructor.
- The entity class should not be final.
- Persistent classes cannot inherit from certain natively-implemented system classes such as java.net.Socket and java.lang.Thread.
- If a persistent class inherits from a non-persistent class, the fields of the non-persistent superclass cannot be persisted.


## 2. A persistence.xml file

This is an XML file placed in the META-INF folder; it's used to specify the persistence provider name, entity class names, and properties like the database connection URL, driver, user, password, and so on.

        <persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd"
        version="2.0">
        <persistence-unit name="trade-mysql-pu" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
        <provider>org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence</provider>
        <class>com.madhusudhan.jsd.domain.jpa.Trade</class>
        <properties>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url"
        value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/JSDATA"/>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class"
        value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
        <property name="hibernate.dialect"
        value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect"/>
        ...
        </properties>
        </persistence-unit>
        </persistence>

Some important things to note about the persistence.xml file:

- it can have multiple persistence units (a logical group of persistent classes, database settings, and relational mappings). Each unit can be used by different JPA vendor or can be used to persist to different databases.
- The vendor-specific persistence provider name is specified in the <provider> tag.
- The entity class names are specified in the <class> tag.
- The database connection properties can be specified within the <properties> tag. Note that the property name will differ for each vendor..

## 3. Write a class that uses an EntityManager

The JPA specification classifies two types of entity managers:
- container-managed: typically a Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) container such as an application server
or a web container
- standalone: standalone program.

In a standalone environment, you should create the EntityManager as shown here:

    private EntityManagerFactory factory = null;
    private EntityManager entityManager = null;
    ..
    private void init() {
    factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("trade-mysql-pu");
    entityManager = factory.createEntityManager();
    }

In a container-managed environment, the class with a reference to the entity manager
(typically DAO objects) will be injected with an existing EntityManager . The responsibility of looking up the persistence unit, creating the factory, and subsequently creating
and injecting the EntityManager are all taken care of by the JEE application container.

# Annotations

@Enitity signifies that a particular class is an entity class. required
@Table When the class name is different from the table name. Not required.
@Column provides the name of the column in a table if it is different from the attribute name. (By default, the two names are assumed to be the same.)
@Id Signifies the primary key.
@GeneratedValue signifies a strategy to assign a unique value to your identity fields automatically. The types of strategies available are IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, TABLE, and AUTO. The default strategy is auto, the implementation of which is left to the JPA vendor to implement. (OpenJPA implements it through a table sequence.)
@Version signifies a version field in an entity. JPA uses a version field to detect concurrent modifications to a data store record. When the JPA runtime detects multiple attempts to concurrently modify the same record, it throws an exception to the transaction attempting to commit last. This prevents you from overwriting the previous commit with stale data.
By default, all the fields are of type @Basic, which are persisted as-is in the database.

# The callbacks

JPA provides callback methods for performing actions at different stages of persistence operations. Imagine that you want to update a customer record, but, before you update, you want to remove the hyphen from the zip code if one is present. Or say that you want to populate some transient fields after a successful fetch. JPA provides listeners for these kinds of activities before and after each fetch, insert, or update operation. The callback methods can be annotated as any of the following:

@PostLoad
@PrePersist
@PostPersist
@PreUpdate
@PostUpdate
@PreRemove
@PostRemove

# Embedded objects
As you've seen so far, the Customer entity has the address information inline in the entity itself. What if you want to apply class normalization concepts and come up with a separate Address class and refer to that in the Customer entity? After all, an address object could be used with Customer, Employee, Order, or User entities.

All you need is an embedded object. You move the address information into a separate class and mark that class as being embeddable, as shown in Listing 10. Refer to this newly created class from the Customer entity with @Embedded annotations.

Listing 10. An embeddable class

    @Embeddable
    public class Address implements Serializable{

        private String street;

        @Column(name = "APPT",nullable = false)  
        private String appt;

        private String city;
    ..
    ..
    }
Embedded classes are mapped together with their owning entity as part of the state of that entity. However, they cannot be queried separately. Listing 11 illustrates a sample entity that uses an embedded object.

A sample entity using an embedded object

    @Entity
    public class Customer {
    ...............
        @Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", nullable = false,length = 50)
        private String firstName;

        @Embedded
        private Address address;
    ..............
    }

You can write the callback methods in the entity class itself, or you can write them in a separate class and reference them in the entity class with @EntityListeners, as shown in Listing 9.

# Inheritance

An entity can extend the following:

Another entity -- either concrete or abstract.
Another non-entity, supplying behavior or non-persistence state. The attributes you inherit from a non-entity are not persisted.
Mapped superclasses, supplying common entity state. Tables in a database have similar fields, but tables are not related to each other.
Let's have a look into the various types of inheritance JPA offers. For this scenario, assume that there are two types of customer: a normal customer who buys products from a physical store and an online customer who buys products over the Internet.

Using Spring
What’s the value input from Spring in supporting JPA, you might ask?

The Spring framework supports the JPA API in couple of ways, very similar to support
for Hibernate. One way is by providing the classic template: a JpaTemplate class. This
class is basically a wrapper around the EntityManager similar to other templates such
as HibernateTemplate .
The second way is by allowing the developer to use plain JPA API in the applications
via an injected EntityManager class. If you are confused as to what approach to take,
go with using plain API if possible. This way, Spring will be used solely for dependency injection thus avoiding any dependencies on its framework classes.

Should you have
earlier versions (before 3.x), perhaps sticking to template style might be easier.
Let’s explore both of these use cases in detail.
Basically, Spring encapsulates the EntityManagerFactory in its own FactoryBean imple-
mentation and injects them into the applications where it is needed.
Spring uses two implementations of FactoryBean for providing the EntityManager s in
respective environments:
org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean
This FactoryBean creates the EntityManagerFactory for standalone environments.
This implementation provides a simple factory that has limitations. It cannot par-
ticipate in global transaction s, cannot work with DataSources .
org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
This factory bean provides the EntityManagerFactory for enterprise environments.
Note how its classname has the word “Container” embedded in it, compared to
the previous LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean class.
