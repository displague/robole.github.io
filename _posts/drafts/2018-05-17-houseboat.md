I couldn't find any up-to-date information on the fees for docking a houseboat in Berlin, [this article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/easy-living-on-the-spree-as-rents-rise-some-berliners-find-refuge-on-the-water-a-809327.html) from 2012 states that it was 70 euro per week in Rummelsburg Bay.

Robert Ade's book [Schwimmding (Germany kindle edition)](https://www.amazon.de/Schwimmding-Robert-Ade-ebook/dp/B00X4JBKNU) detailed his construction of a houseboat in Berlin.

There are professional services like [Hausboot Kompass](http://hausboot-kompass.de/) that provide end-to-end services if required.
