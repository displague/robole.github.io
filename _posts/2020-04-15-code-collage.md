A collage is an "artistic  composition made of various materials (such as paper, cloth, or wood)  glued on a surface". What do you call code composed from various sources and glued together?

Do you find yourself writing code in short spurts before needing to go on a merry code hunt in your favourite search engine? It's a warning sign if it's happening more than a bit. You're playing Dr Frankenstein really. We have all been there (probably), I know I have. It's an indicator that you're gone too far, too soon. You need to go back and understand more. The clichÃ© is someone learning a framework before they know the language it's based on, well, at all!

The thing is that no-one is immune to this completely. If we are honest, to some extent, we just want the result, not the striving, nor the doing really. Give me a statue already. Your code collage might even work. If you can copy-and-paste your way to glory, imagine if you learn something well and understand it thoroughly! Hail, Caesar!

But a more basic psychology plays a stronger role. We procrastinate and must cram, and don't have time to read documentation on become acquainted with something unfamiliar. We don't say 'No' to an unrealistic demand. We wander too far out of zone of competence, and we can't do what is expected by yourself, or others. We are pressurised by management. We are anxious about a deadline and lose rationality. The reptile quarter of our brain takes over.

The obvious antidote is to know the fundamentals of the technology you are working in well, don't bypass something because you think you know it, confirm it. Get advice from experienced peers to know what is important. The flipside is that in some jobs, the demands are not that various, you get asked to do a variation of the same work often. So you can find a comfortable niche of knowledge and you don't have to stray from that. It's only when you have to, it becomes a shock, and you may jump into collage mode, amnesia kicks in about your past collages.

> The simplest advice is: don't be rushed, and ask questions first. This will serve you well whatever you need to do.

But also, for me at least, it's about knowing yourself better, and learning how to deal with situations better. We have 2 systems of thought: System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; and System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Guess which gets you trouble most often? System 1. The simplest advice is: don't be rushed, and ask questions first. This will serve you well whatever you need to do.

What has this got to do with a serial killer? Strange documents from an unidentifiable source! An inexplicable pathology! Maybe, there is a serial code collager who is a neighbour, or a colleague, and is normal by all other standards. You may only know if you stumble across their code!

Happy coding!
