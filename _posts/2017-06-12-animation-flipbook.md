A useful technique to have at one's disposal would be a quick way to create a simple responsive animation. So, not an animated GIF!  


As a starting point we could emulate the effect of a flipbook. When I was a kid I used a block of post-it notes to create a series of frames, beginning from the top down, and then flipped through them to "run" the animation! So, it's a series of overlayed images with different poses, cycle through the images to create the animation. What is the best way to do this on the web?  


We should use SVG, the quality will not degrade on resizing.


We can use opacity to fade one image in and fade the other out. This can be achieved easily with CSS animation.  


Here is a simple example showing Donald Trump yawping!

<p data-height="365" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LLzYBY" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robjoeol" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="trump yawp" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol/pen/LLzYBY/">trump yawp</a> by rob (<a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol">@robjoeol</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

This technique is not very suitable for more than a few frames, each frame requires a @keyframes block, and these blocks need to be coordinated with each other to make a smooth transition for the animation. An animation library should be used for anything more complex than that!
