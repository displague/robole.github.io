I learn a new concept or technology, and I try to make a small, silly thing with it as quickly as I can. If I can come up with something amusing, it helps to make it more fun bringing it to life.

Exhibit A. *Trump channelling Kanye*.

<p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robjoeol" data-slug-hash="qeabZe" style="height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Trump channelling Kanye">

While learning AJAX, I made this. I searched for a fun, free API to use. [Kanye.rest](http://kanye.rest) jumped out at me! So, I was thinking about how to show Kanye West quotes in an interesting way, I wanted to do something more than just putting the Kanye quote inside a `<blockquote>`. I remembered Kanye quoting Trump, so why not have Trump quoting Kanye for comic value? Previously, I had made a bobble-head animation of Trump, so I added Kanye to that.

Also, I try to build a small piece of a larger project, which I would like to complete, but do not know enough to finish it right now! 

Games generally are more fun to make. I was thinking of making a Breaking Bad edition of Monopoly. I enjoy doing some artwork, so combining the programming with some graphic design makes it more engaging for me. I knew that I could make the Community Cards immediately, so I thought that was a good starting point to see if it was fun to make.

Making this helped me to realise that it would take quite some time to do a high quality version of the idea. I didn't want to dedicate that much time to it, which led me to try something smaller and simpler in the mean time. I could make a card game like [Top Trumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps) instead and I would use a similar knowledge set.

You can reverse the process also, make a list of things you would like to learn first. Then, you can find a project, or think of a project that utilises those topics and technologies, and look to build it piece by piece over time.

When I learn a new topic or improve on something, I audit my previous projects to see if I can improve them somehow, or take them further. Seeing this incremental improvement and being able to complete a larger project to a high standard can feel very rewarding. I hope this inspires you find new ways to sustain your progress in learning a new topic, language, or technology.

Happy coding! üßë‚Äçüíª‚≠ê
