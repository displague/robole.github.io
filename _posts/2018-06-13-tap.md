This is an idea inspired by the mention of "Toggles, Taps, and Techniques". The idea was to have taps that act as toggles to run water into the sink. Probably slightly less practical than the usual technique, as you can't control the water pressure, but I can make my own rules here!

I wanted a simplified bird's eye view for something visually different.
