## Food recipes (idea)

Get a machine learning algorithm to learn what the most common pairing of ingredients in existing recipes are.  
Maybe create clustering for understanding if for example they always have an element of each (i suspect might be true): a carb, a protein, a fat, sugar, soft/hard texture etc…   

Then get a model that generates own recipes.

What for ?

*   Maybe we can find new combinations of foods not commonly used yet.  

*   Maybe regarding health we could have the equivalent substitution element that contains less calories, or contains more of a certain nutrient that a person needs. - it would generate personalized recipes.
