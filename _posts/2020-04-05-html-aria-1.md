# ARIA: singing from the same hymn sheet

Nope. Not *this* aria!

## What is ARIA?

We're talking about *accessibility*!  

Accessibility refers to the creation of digital content that can be used by everyone.  

<blockquote>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. - World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>) </blockquote>

The W3C documentation is not easy reading, but finally I have read through the specification and guides to understand it properly for myself. 

### Tell me already

If you create your own whizz-bang Date Picker, how will a screen reader know what it is?

You need to tell it. Use [ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/), WAI-ARIA, license to include!

**ARIA is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specification with the aim of improving accessibility for modern web applications, in particular for dynamic content and custom user interface (UI) controls**. It defines a set of attributes that can provide additional semantics to elements. 

ARIA has no effect on how elements are displayed or behave in browsers. Its purpose is to **provide extra description for Assistive Technologies (ATs)** when needed. 

The most common Use Cases for ARIA are:

1. Assist in identifying the major regions of your page to make navigation easier (these are called landmarks);
2. Identify and describe a custom <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> control;
3. Tell a user when you are loading dynamic content;
4. Alert a user when something important pops up;
5. Tell screen readers when the state of the page changes.

ARIA is our last stop for accessibility, the previous post spoke about what you should be doing already.

## Rules of ARIA

The W3C made [some rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#NOTES) as guidelines to help you use ARIA properly. 

> The first rule of ARIA is, do not use ARIA, if possible!

These are the rules:

1. **If you *can* use a native HTML element or attribute** with the semantics and behaviour you require already built in, **then use it!**

2. **Do not change native semantics, unless you *really* have to**.  If you give a `div` a `role="button"`, there is no *'hey presto, now I am button'* moment. It does not have all of the typical keyboard events you associate with a button.

   ```html
   <div role="button">Faker</button>
   ```

3. **All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard.** For example, if you use `role=button`, the element must be able to receive focus and a user must be able to activate the action associated with the element using **both** the <kbd>enter</kbd> (on WIN OS); or <kbd>return</kbd> (MAC OS) and <kbd>space</kbd>.

4. Do not use `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on a **focusable** element .

5. All interactive elements must have an [accessible name](http://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/#dfn-accessible-name).  Using a `label` for an `input` takes care of most cases in HTML, but if you make a custom UI control, then add an ARIA label (we discuss this more later).

## Features

There are three main features of ARIA:

- **Roles** â€” These define what an element is or does.
- **Properties** â€” Properties are attributes that are inherent to an object. Properties are less likely to change than *states*, but that is not a rule. For example, `aria-label="signup form"` gives a form an accessible name.
- **States** â€” A state is a property of an object that may change in response to user action or automated process. For example, `aria-disabled="true"` specifies that the element is currently disabled. 

The distinction between *states* and *properties* is not strong,  they both are attributes prefixed with "*aria-*".  It is of little consequence to most web content authors which is which, so you may see them simply referred to as attributes. I will speak about them together later.

### Tell me more. Show me code.

If you want me to follow up and write more, let me know. Thanks for reading. ðŸ˜Š
