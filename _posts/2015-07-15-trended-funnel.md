## Visualization pattern - Trended Funnel

To visualize a funnel over time we can use an Area Chart (not a stacked chart) !  
Notice that is over-time, thus we can see the funnel changing with time, this is more information rich than the usual typical (static) funnel view.

See in above picture as example, each “wave” represents a step in the funnel.  
The widest wave represents start of funnel, and then each inside “wave” represent the next steps (see chart annotations)

A small gap between waves means high conversion rate between steps, while wider gaps represents a bigger drop off, and often is where we need to focus attention on to improve.  

_Small technicality in Excel:_ When getting the data ready to plot make sure data is ordered by size volume (i.e. ordered by funnel correct steps sequence)
