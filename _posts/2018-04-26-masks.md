# Use a mask image as the src for an &lt;img&gt;

Set the *background* to the Harry Potter
image, and create a mask image to use as the *src*.

For the mask image, you want the interior of the tree
shape to be transparent, and the rest to match the
background colour of the page (or containing element).

I found it easiest to take an square PNG with
a transparent background and a green foreground
colour, and erase the foreground to create the shape.

## Browser Support
Because it's using a png as the *src* of the img, it works in almost every browser.

# Use clip-path on an &lt;img&gt;

Creating a clip-path is pretty versatile, but
is a bit difficult to create a very intricate
shape. [Clippy](http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is
a nice interactive tool to create the shape.

I was lazy and created an evergreen tree
instead of a deciduous tree, a far simpler shape! ðŸ˜…

## Browser Support

Is clip-path on HTML elements supported in all browsers?

[Not that well at the moment](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-clip-path), this example works in Chrome and Firefox. Firefox is the only browser to support using a clip-path on an external SVG.

# Conclusion

If you want broader browser support (almost 100%), you should choose using a mask image. One drawback is that if you want it to be responsive, you need to create a mask image to match the size of each background image you use.

Clip-path is supported by Chrome and Firefox, which is about 60% of the market. The clip-path only needs to be defined once and will scale to match any image size that has the same proportions.
