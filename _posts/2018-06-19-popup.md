This is for the [June Codepen Challenge](https://blog.codepen.io/2018/06/18/codepen-challenge-figure-figcaption/), the weekly challenge is to: "design a beautiful and/or unique *figure* and *figcapation* pairing".

I wanted to emulate a children's pop-up book, where you have a pull-out tab to make some of the cardboard figures makes some movements to aid in the storytelling.

I made the *figcapation* the pull-out tab, when you click on it, it grows gets wider (longer) to emulate being pulled out. This initiates some simple movements for the images contained inside the *figure*.
