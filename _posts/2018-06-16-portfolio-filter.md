A filter on a personal portfolio is a standard feature. I wanted to try a javascript library that could do this with some transitions to create a slick experience, and have flexibility what values you can filter on.

[Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) does this well, it has different grid-based layouts, and you use classes on items to define what you want filtered. The website has some good examples. It is an open-source license for non-commercial use.

I specifically wanted to create a "logical or" filter with multiple values, for example, you can find all projects that use "java" or "python" using the checkboxes. You can toggle them with the "all" checkbox.
