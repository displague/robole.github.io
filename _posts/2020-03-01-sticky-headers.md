CSS introduced the property `position: sticky` in 2012, one obvious application of this is for making sticky headers. 

The idea is straightforward: If an element has `position: sticky`, treat it as a normal `position: relative` block, as long as it‚Äôs on screen. If the user scrolls far enough that the element (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a `h1`) would be scrolled off the screen, but the `h1`‚Äôs parent div is still visible onscreen, treat it as though it were `position: fixed` with the position you set it to through the properties: `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`.

Initially, the problem with this property was that adoption was slow by some browser vendors, but that has changed long since 2012, so we can embrace it without big reservations now! There is a caveat with tables, which I will discuss below.

## So, how do you make sticky headers with just css?

It‚Äôs super-easy. All you do is:

```css
.stayOnTop{
    position: -webkit-sticky;
    position: -moz-sticky;
    position: -ms-sticky;
    position: -o-sticky;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}
```
and that element will stay on top always. Using the browser prefixes is still necessary for some Browsers such as Safari, so it's best to add them all to avoid mishaps!

## Tables

One of the best use-cases for this is bigggg tables. That is, tables where you want to see the column headers on top as you scroll down.

There is one caveat though, Chrome and Edge have a bug with using `position: sticky` on `thead`. So, the way around this is to apply it to `th` instead.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MBvLLZ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robjoeol" data-pen-title="Table Sticky Header using position:sticky;" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol/pen/MBvLLZ/">Table Sticky Header using position:sticky;</a> by rob (<a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol">@robjoeol</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

You can also use it to make sticky headers on the side and top for easy cross-referencing for big data sets, maybe you're showing scientific findings like below! So, it kind of mimics frozen rows in Excel!

<p data-height="417" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="KBQbNG" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robjoeol" data-pen-title="Cell Zoom üîç" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol/pen/KBQbNG/">Cell Zoom üîç</a> by rob (<a href="https://codepen.io/robjoeol">@robjoeol</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

## Browser Support

As long as you avoid using it on `thead`, you are good on the major desktop browsers (see green-shaded squares in image below). IE be damned!
