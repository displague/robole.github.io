# How to explain Web technologies to a 12-year old

The Web was cooler in my imagination when I was younger. Mostly because I had to imagine what it was really like, while I was listening to dial-up tones, and seeing pages load in slow marching blocks. Imagine an interactive map which will give you directions? Yeah right. What sorcery is that? I learned how about Web technologies properly later.

How would you give a simple, yet interesting explanation to a 12 -year old now?

## If the Web was a language..

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> would be the nouns. HTML defines every thing.

HTML is like a girlfriend who is not so clever and gets jealous easily, she always wants to know what every thing *means*! The relationship works best when you tell her what everything is, otherwise you don't know what will happen. She could ignore it, or she could make a big mess for you. Overall, she is forgiving, which makes life go more smoothly.

The things of HTML are like a married couple. You share a name and keep your things between yourselves. Marriage is rewarding but it requires some elbow work. The things in HTML are called *elements*. Married couples keep content.

HTML is like the Uncle who is always trying to be cool. He makes up nicknames that stick sometimes. 

Uncle is single.
