The idea was to create a cool transition to single out a  footballer's face in pre-match photo when hovering over his name.

I used ```clip-path``` to single out each face, it was easy to create the CSS with [clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/), it is a nice WSIWYG web editor.

The photo is of German's starting 11 versus Mexico in their opening game of World Cup 2018. It kind of looks like a police line-up with the effect, they way they played was criminal anyway! :-D
