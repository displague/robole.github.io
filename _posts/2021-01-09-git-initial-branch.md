Last July, some of the git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) changed the default branch name to `main` (from `master`). However, Git did not! ðŸ¤¦

It's disappointing that they didn't act in unison to make the same change. Putting the motivation behind the change aside, the result is that they have created a bit of work for users. I hate meddling with configuration!

I managed to avoid this altogether until now. It was only creating a new repo on GitHub this week that it surfaced again. I forgot that this was a thing! So, time to set things up to avoid this in future.

## How can I fix this for new repos?

You can change the default name in Git, or change the default name on your git hosting provider.

It's probably easier to do it in Git, especially if you use more than one provider.

### Change default branch name in Git

[Git 2.28](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq5za8hpir.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/) (released in July 2020) introduced `init.defaultBranch` configratuion option.  Check you have the 2.28 or later installed to avail of this.

```bash
git --version
```

If you don't, [download and install the latest](https://git-scm.com/download/).

Now, you can update the default branch name.

```bash
 git config --global init.defaultBranch main
 ```

### Change default branch name in GitHub

See [GitHub Docs - Managing the default branch name for your repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)

## And what about exisiting repos?

For existing repos, you can still push and pull without needing to rename the default branch. So, option 1 is to do nothing!

Option 2 is to rename. You need to consider what other people are doing before you go ahead, it will piss people off if they have existing PRs and you don't let them know! You're forcing clones to rename also.

### Shortest way (?)

The shortest set of steps is probably:

1. Disable **Default Branch and Protected Branches** settings if applicable.
1. Go to the master branch.
1. Fetch latest (if in doubt).
1. Rename the branch to `main`. This preserves history.
1. Push changes and update upstream remote link (`git push -u origin main`).
1. Go to the Settings on GitHub (Settings > Branches > Default Branch)or GitLab (Settings > Repository > Default Branch) and change the default branch to `main`.
1. Delete remote `master` branch.

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```

Go to the Settings on GitHub or GitLab and change the default branch to `main`. Then, you can delete `master` remotely.

```bash
git push origin --delete master
```

## Don't forget to update related CI/CD configurations

If you do change exisiting repos, do not forget your build chain. You will need to update their configuration to be in step with your repo. If they depend on an "origin/master" branch, they will complain eventually, to someone!

### Netlify

If you deploy to Netlify using a git repo, you'll need to tell Netlify you've updated the default branch (what they call the production branch).

1. Log in and find the site
1. Go to Deploys
1. Click Deploy Settings
1. Under Deploy contexts click Edit settings
1. Change the name of the production branch and click Save

Note: There may still be a "branch deploy" for master after you click save. You can remove this by just editing the settings one more time and removing master from the "Let me add individual branches" section.

### GitHub Actions & GitLab CI/CD

A simple find-and-replace of "master" in your configuration files  should be sufficient.

## Conclusion

I chose to update my Git configuration. Going forward, I will use the  default of `main` for new projects. I will leave my existing projects as they are.
