# Pimp your Blog: Layout and readability





## Readability

While studies have been done on text readability, most are inconclusive, some are contradictory, and, in general, there isn't a lot of it out there.

You also have to take into account:

- the typeface being used
- the leading (line-spacing)
- margins
- context (newspaper? Billboard?)

The best solution, IMHO, is to read what you design. Dog-fooding!

## Short Guidelines

- 12 point size font as an absolute minimum,
- Donâ€™t condense letter spacing,
- when changing line length, change the leading accordingly,
- Remember: optimal is not necessarily fastest reading line length but is the size preferred by the users,
- think about the impact on line length and leading when changing font size,
- keep the text layout clean and uncluttered and use enough [white space](https://www.paulolyslager.com/call-to-action-buttons-placement/).

## Choose the right typography

The typeface you chose affects the readability of your content, and gives a perception of you to the reader.

### How do I make it easy to read?

Choose a legible typeface that fits the piece of content.

The typical advice is if you don't know typography well, choose a maximum of 2 typefaces: 1 for headings and short text, and 1 for body text. 

Serif fonts are generally more legible for larger blocks of text. So, it is





1. Georgia: Sleek and professional. Smaller than many other fonts, great to read when smaller text is required.
2. Helvetica: Professional and fun. Used a lot by businesses for headlines and logos.
3. Calibri: Clean and familiar. Used by Windows by default.
4. Verdana: Classic. Seen as safe (boring) choice in Design industry.
