# How to explain HTML to a teenager

The Web was cooler in my imagination when I was younger. Mostly because I had to imagine what it was really like, while I was listening to dial-up tones, and seeing pages load in slow marching blocks.

Things are different today, fortunately.

How would you give a simple, yet interesting explanation to a teenager now?

## Imagine that the Web is a language..

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2020-04-07-web-to-12yr-old/web-venn-diagram.png" alt="Venn diagram of web technologies. HTML is nouns, CSS is adjectives, Javascript is verbs." style="width:80vw;max-width:800px;"/>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> would be the nouns. HTML defines every thing.

## HTML is like..

HTML is like a girlfriend who gets jealous easily, she always wants to know what every thing *means*! The relationship works best when you tell her what everything is, otherwise you don't know what will happen. She could ignore something, or she could make a big mess of something. Overall, she is forgiving, which makes life go more smoothly.

The things of HTML are like a married couple. You share a name and keep your things between each other. Marriage is rewarding but it requires some elbow work. The things in HTML are called *elements*. Married couples keep content.

HTML is like the Uncle who is always trying to be cool. He makes up nicknames that stick sometimes. 

Uncle is single.
