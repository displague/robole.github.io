  <h1>Invoicing</h1>
  <p>The Owner of the business wanted to reduce mistakes and improve efficiency for producing invoices. He wanted to continue using Microsoft Excel, and  had a small number of big clients. So, a simple solution in Excel was preferable.</p>
  <p>I compiled a full product listing. I created the application in Excel with dropdown lists for the entry of the products and categories for each line item, which would autofill the prices on selection.</p>
  <p>The Manager could update the product list with new products and prices if desired, and the Application would update the dropdown lists instantly.</p>
