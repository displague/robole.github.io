  <h1>Invoicing</h1>
  <p>The Owner of the business wanted to reduce entry mistakes and improve efficiency for creating invoices. He wanted to continue using Microsoft Excel, and had a small number of big clients. So, a simple solution in Excel was preferable.</p>
  <p>I compiled a full product list. I created the application to put dropdown lists for the entry of the products and categories for each line item within a worksheet, the prices would be autofilled on selection.</p>
  <p>The Manager can update the product list with new products and prices if desired, and the Application will update the dropdown lists instantly.</p>
