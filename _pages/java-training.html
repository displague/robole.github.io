  <h1>Java Training</h1>
  <p>I have taught and mentored a wide variety of people from different
    backgrounds, and with different levels of experience.</p>
  <p>I can help people to understand the core concepts, and the intricate
    details of each topic. I try to inject some fun to create a pleasant and
     memorable learning experience.</p>
  <p>I highlight where in real-world projects these
    concepts are applied, and explain other scenarios
     where these concepts can be applied.</p>
  <h1>Sample Projects</h1>
  <p>I have compiled a collection of good example solutions to projects
    to provide guidance of how to approach design and development. Some are
    games and others are based on university assignments.</p>
