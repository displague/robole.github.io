  <h1>Java Training</h1>
  <p>I have taught a wide variety of people with different backgrounds, different nationalties, and different levels of experience.</p>
  <p>I can help people to understand the core concepts, and the intricate details of each topic. I use exercises and examples to practically apply the concepts as we progress through each topic, highlighting in real-world projects where these concepts are applied, and explain other situations where these concepts can be used.</p>
  <h1>Sample Notes</h1>
  <h2>Oracle Certification</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/java/2016/07/30/intro-java-1-1.html">1.1 - Declaration &amp; Access Control</a></li>
    <li><a href="/java/2016/08/01/intro-java-1-2.html">1.2 - Object Orientation</a></li>
    <li><a href="/java/2016/08/02/intro-java-1-3.html">1.3 - Assignments</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/java/2017/03/16/java-interfaces.html">Interfaces in Java - What, Why and How?</a></li>

  </ul>
  <h1>Sample Projects</h1>
  <p>I emphasize analysing the requirements fully first, then creating a design. For more advanced students, a UML design model. The design model can be used to generate skeleton classes to begin writing the code. I encourage a test-driven development approach, when a student is at an appropriate level to understand it fully and benefit from it.</p>
  <p>I have compiled a collection of good example solutions to projects and common problems to provide guidance of how to approach design and development.</p>
  <h2>Grocery Warehouse Management System</h2>
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>Write a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or command-line application to manage customers, sales and inventory for a Grocery Warehouse.</p>
  <h3>Topics to know in order to complete the project</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Java syntax and programming basics</li>
    <li>How to implement Classes with instance variables and methods</li>
    <li>How to implement a design using OO Concepts such as: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Composition</li>
    <li>Abstract classes</li>
    <li>Interfaces</li>
    <li>Error Handling</li>
    <li>GUI Design: Swing Components and Layout Managers</li>
    <li>Event-driven programming (ActionListeners)</li>
    <li>Collections</li>
    <li>File I/O</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Difficulty</h3>
  <p>Suitable for advanced students only. This could be 20-40 hours of work depending on how well the topics are understood. The assignment outlined is a good example of a difficult specification that has: verbose explainations, restating requirements in slightly different ways or adding extra detail in different sections, some prescriptive demands e.g. define a Customer class with addSale method, and some conflicting requirements that need some compromise to accomodate.</p>
