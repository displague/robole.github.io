  <h1>Metro App</h1>
  <p>A friendly, intuitive app for navigating commuter transport services and planning journeys in many cities, with maps and schedules available for offline use.</p>
  <h1>Storyboard</h1>

  <h1>Wireframe Demo</h1>

  <h1>Motivation</h1>
  <p>The idea for this app was borne from my frustration of using transport apps!</p>
  <p>When travelling, a transport app may require an internet connection, which can be a
    problem if you do not have a local SIM or you may not be able to access the internet
    while on a train! Often, there is no information or orientation for someone who is completely
    unfamiliar with the city and ticketing system. And additionally, the signs and announcements may
    be in a language that you cannot read or understand, which makes it very difficult to navigate
    the transport system!</p>
  <p>Even when using a transport app in your own city, schedule information is generally absent. So,
    planning a trip at a particular time is not possible in the app. The user interfaces are prohibitive,
    you cannot explore the travel times across the city, and it is difficult to visualise the route for
    your planned journey.</p>
    <p>There are many areas for improvements. These are the areas I have identified:
      <ol>
        <li>Allow different views of the transit system for a clearer overview and selection of stations for a route.</li>
        <li>Include schedule information.</li>
        <li>Allow map and schedule to be viewed simultaneously and to be toggled easily.</li>
        <li>Show a clear route for your planned journey.</li>
        <li>Allow the user to simulate the journey to know when to transfer.</li>
        <li>Make map and schedule data available for offline access.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>After outlining my motivation, I made the storyboard.</p>
    <p>Then, I made some rough drafts of some screens to solidify my thoughts on each section</p> 
    <p>I wrote a <a href="assets\documents\Metro App Design v0-1.pdf">short design document</a> to outline
      the characteristics of the app in more detail and create some draft screens</p>
    <p>I started creating the screens with higher fidelity in Adobe XD and created a wireframe demo.</p>
