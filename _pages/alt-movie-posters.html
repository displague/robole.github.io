<h1>Alternative Posters</h1>
<p>Posters of movies and tv shows are made for promotion. They tend to be
  as explicit and eye-catching as possible. They highlight it's
  star actors in favour of the story quite often.<p/>
  <p>The trend of alternative posters is antithetical to this, the objective is
  to capture the mood and emotions of the story. They are expressive and
  lyrical. You could classify it as a specific type of "fan art", but I think
  that perception is belittling. It is good art in it's own right.</p>
