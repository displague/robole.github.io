<h1>Alternative Posters</h1>
<p>Posters of movies and tv shows are made for promotion. They tend to be
  as explicit and eye-catching as possible, and often they highlight the
  star actors in favour of the story. Alternative posters are oppose this.<p/>
  <p>Typically, the posters focus on the essence and emotions of the story. There is a
    really interesting and varied mix of styles and form. The depictions range from
    grand summaries of the story, to minimalist interpetations such as
    <a href="https://www.chungkong.nl/">chungkong</a>.</p>
  <p>It has become its own genre. <a href="https://mondotees.com/collections/posters">Mondo</a> are
    widely credited for popularising it with their prints. The Academy of Motion
    Picture Arts and Sciences recently started adding Mondo's work to its
    collection, so the industry is taking notice. It has gone beyond fan art, but
   is still an alternative to what the movie studios are largely doing. Although,
 Paramount Studios did colloborate with Mondo for posters for Transformers: Dark
 of the Moon and Captain Ameria: The First Avenger</p>
