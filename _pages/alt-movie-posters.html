<h1>Alternative Posters</h1>
<p>Posters of movies and tv shows are made for promotion. They tend to be
  as explicit and eye-catching as possible, and often they highlight the
  star actors in favour of the story.<p/>
  <p>The trend of alternative posters is antithetical to this, typically, the
    objective is to capture the essence and emotions of the story. Some
    artists create grand summaries, and some create minimalist
    interpetations such as <a href="https://www.chungkong.nl/">chungkong
  </a>. There is a really interesting cross-section of styles.</p>
  <p>It has become it's own genre and has influenced change in what is produced
    by movie and tv studios also. You could classify it as a specific type of
    "fan art", but I think that perception is a bit belittling. It is good
    art in it's own right.</p>
