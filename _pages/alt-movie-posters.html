<h1>Alternative Posters</h1>
<p>Posters of movies and tv shows are made for promotion. They tend to be
  as explicit and eye-catching as possible, and often they highlight the
  star actors in favour of the story.<p/>
  <p>It has become it's own unofficial genre. <a href="https://mondotees.com/collections/posters">Mondo</a> are
    widely credited for popularising it with their prints. The Academy of Motion
    Picture Arts and Sciences recently started adding Mondo's work to its
    collection, so the industry is taking notice. It is going beyond fan art, but
  as the name suggests, it is an alternative to what the movie studios are doing
to a large extent.</p>
  <p>Typically, the objective is to capture the essence and emotions of the story. There is a
    really interesting mix of styles and form that are as varied as the artists
    who lend themselves to it. The depictions range from
    grand summaries of the story, to minimalist interpetations such as
