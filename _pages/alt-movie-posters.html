<h1>Alternative Posters</h1>
<p>Posters for movies and tv shows are made for promotion. They tend to
  be as explicit and eye-catching as possible, heralding the stars is of paramount
  importance. Alternative posters deviate from this, and tend to be more artistic
  interpetations of the story, artists explore different styles and forms
  without constraints.<p/>
<p>Here are my explorations. My work has been featured on <a href="https://alternativemovieposters.com/portfolio_category/rob-oleary/">
alternativemovieposters.com</a>.</p>
