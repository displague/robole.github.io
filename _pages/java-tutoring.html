  <h1>Java Tutoring</h1>
  <p>I have taught a wide variety of students with different backgrounds, nationalties, and experience.</p>
  <p>I emphasize analysis and design to turn a specification into a design before writing code, and using a test-driven development approach. I have compiled a collection of good example solutions to assignments to provide clear guidance of achieve this.</p>
