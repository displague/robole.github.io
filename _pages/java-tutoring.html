  <h1>Java Tutoring</h1>
  <p>I have taught a wide variety of students with different backgrounds, nationalties, and experience.</p>
  <p>I emphasize analysing the requirements to write a design before writing any code, and adopt a test-driven development approach when students are at an appropriate level. I have compiled a collection of good example solutions to assignments to provide guidance for students and teachers.</p>
  <h1>Sample Projects</h1>
  <h2>Grocery Warehouse Management System</h2>
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>Write a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or command-line application to manage customers, sales and inventory for a Grocery Warehouse.</p>

  <h3>Topics to know in order to complete the project</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Java syntax and programming basics</li>
    <li>How to implement Classes with instance variables and methods</li>
    <li>How to implement a design using OO Concepts such as: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Composition</li>
    <li>Abstract classes</li>
    <li>Interfaces</li>
    <li>Error Handling</li>
    <li>GUI Design: Swing Components and Layout Managers</li>
    <li>Event-driven programming (ActionListeners)</li>
    <li>Collections</li>
    <li>File I/O</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Difficulty</h3>
  <p>Suitable for advanced students. This could be 20-40 hours of work when material is covered but it is hard to say exactly as the specification is quite verbose and has requirements that are counter-intuitive.</p>
