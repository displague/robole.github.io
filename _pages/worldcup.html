<h1 class="world-cup">⚽️ World Cup 🏆</h1>
<h2 class="world-cup">Objective</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To create an appealing, responsive website that allows
  people to easily explore the teams and matches in the Fifa World
  Cup 2018.</li>
  <li>To make the data available through a REST API
  for developers! One love, yo!👩‍💻💓👨‍💻</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="world-cup">Motivation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">official Fifa website</a>
  has a poor mobile user experience. I will tweak their design to render
  well on all devices.</p>
<p>There is a free <a href="https://worldcup.sfg.io/">REST API</a>
  by the people at <a href="https://softwareforgood.com/soccer-good/">Software
    for Good</a></i>. It scrapes data from the Fifa website, the data
    available is predominantly for matches, I will blend it with my
    API to provide a more complete dataset.🍹</p>
<h2 class="world-cup">Finished Application</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://worldcup-nirvana.herokuapp.com/">try it!</a></p>
<p>It is hosted on heroku using a free account, so the website sleeps
after 30 minutes of inactivity <i class="em-svg em-female_zombie"
></i>, it will take 2 minutes for the website to appear for you!</p>

<h2 class="world-cup">Tech Stack</h2>
<p>I wanted to try <em>Spring Data Rest</em>, which is an opinionated library
  that minimises code needed to make REST endpoints. It is only necessary to define
  domain classes with accompanying simple repository classes. I wanted to
  discover what the benefits and constraints are, and see if you would use this
  for an production application.</p>
<p>I chose Postgres as the database, Heroku supports it
on its free tier, so I can deploy it for free. Vanilla
javascript was sufficient for the front-end, I wanted to
exclude front-end frameworks from the equation,
the focus was to explore the backend portion of the
stack, and improve the UI. There is an opportunity to return
later and use a front-end framework for further learning.</p>
