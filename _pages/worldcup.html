<h1 class="world-cup">World Cup</h1>
<h2 class="world-cup">Objective</h2>
<p>I wanted to create an appealing, responsive website to allow
  people to easily explore the teams and matches in the Fifa World
  Cup 2018. Also, to make the data available through a REST API
  for developers to use in whatever maniacal way they think of!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">official Fifa website</a> has most of the features I would like
  to implement but it is lacking in some areas, so I will base my
  design on their website, but make some changes.</p>
<h2 class="world-cup">Finished Application</h2>
<p>The finished application is hosted <a href="https://evening-crag-42596.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
on heroku. Because it is hosted using a free account, the
performance is limited. The website sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity.
So, it may take 2 minutes for the website to be appear for you.</p>
<h2 class="world-cup">Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>Homepage: The <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">Fifa
  homepage</a> looks poor on smaller screens, the navigation is
  obscured with a scrollbar. A sticky navigation bar that
  turns into a dropdown that can be toggled is preferable.<img src="/assets/img/portfolio/worldcup/fifa-homepage.png"
style="display:block;clear:both;" alt="fifa homepage" /></li>
<li>Homepage: The next 4 matches are shown on the homepage, which
  again looks poor on mobile. I would like to show the next 2 games,
  and stack them vertically on mobile.</li>
<li>Matches: Fifa shows a long list grouped by stage("Knockout Phase" by default), and ordered by date (30 Jun
   and ascending). I would prefer to see the upcoming matches
   on top, the next 1-4 matches (depending on the stage). It can
   be clicked on to show all upcoming games within a complete
   list.</li>
<li>Matches: The complete list can be grouped by "all", "results",
     and "upcoming".</li>
<li>Matches: The complete list can be filtered by "team".</li>
<li>Players: Fifa shows a picture of the player with his
    team and position. I would like to show this in a similar way
    but display some information when you hover over the player.
  </li>
  <li>Players: When you browse all of the players,
  it loads images for every single player, lazy loading of
  images would be preferable.</li>
  <li>Players: Filter by "team" and "position".</li>
  <li>Players: Clicking on the player will show a profile page
    featuring their key stats.</li>
  <li>Teams: Fifa does a good job. I would prefer to just have
    country flag as a card and show their ranking.</li>
  </li>
  <li>Teams: Clicking on the team will show a profile page with
  key stats.</li>
  <li>Stadiums: Show the stadiums as an icon on a map, with each
    scaled by capacity.
  </li>
  <li>Stadiums: The data of the stadium will be show as a companion
    table when you click on the icon</li>
  <li>Dream team: Pick a dream team from any of the players.</li>
  <li>Dream team: Choose a formation and show players on the
    pitch as a portait photo with their name.</li>
  <li>Dream team: Choose a formation and show players on the
      pitch as a portait photo with their name.</li>
  <li>Dream team: You can see a player's key stats on hover.</li>
  <li>Dream team: You can auto-complete the team.</li>
  <li>Dream team: You can clear all players.</li>
  <li>Developer API: Shows all of the endpoints available grouped
    by resource, and styled similarly to most professional web
    services.</li>

<p>I wanted to make a slight depature from the typical formats. The
  interface used in fantasy football leagues, usually displays
  the player as the team jersey with their surname underneath.</p>

<p>In newspaper articles, it is popular to make a simple graphic to
  show the lineup, players are displayed as a shape (typically a
  circle) with their surname underneath.</p>

<p>Instead, I wanted to use a portrait of a player, have the full
  name in a caption underneath, and give some stats that extend
  from this caption when hovered over. Not revolutionary, but it
  looks better to me! On mobile, the portrait can be reduced in size, and the name can be changed to be the
  surname only, or can be hidden, depending on the space.</p>

 <p>Also, I wanted to change how players are selected or swapped. Double-clicking
   will trigger a selection or change, the position is highlighted, a drawer
   will slide in from the right, offering the alternative players that can be selected
   for that position. More economic use of screen real estate than in Fantasy
   Football. For mobile, the drawer will take up the entire screen with a close
   button.</p>

<p>Rather than do a pencil design, I wanted to create a prototype to
  explore the use of the space on the screen, so that elements don't
  become too squashed or overlap. You can see the prototype below.</p>
