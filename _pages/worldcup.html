<h1 class="world-cup">⚽️ World Cup 🏆</h1>
<h2 class="world-cup">Objective</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To create an appealing, responsive website that allows
  people to easily explore the teams and matches in the Fifa World
  Cup 2018.</li>
  <li>To make the data available through a REST API
  for developers! One love, yo!👩‍💻💓👨‍💻</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="world-cup">Motivation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">official Fifa website</a>
  has a poor mobile user experience. It can be improved upon generally. I
  didn't see any other single website that offered a good guide to the world
  cup, along with live scores, and results. I wanted to
  see if I could make a happy home for all of that.</p>
<p>There are not many good APIs for world cup data.<i class="em-svg em-unicorn_face"></i> This was addressed
  partially through this <a href="https://worldcup.sfg.io/">REST
    API</a> by the people at <a href="https://softwareforgood.com/soccer-good/">Software
      for Good</a></i>. It scrapes data from the Fifa website and has been made availabe for
    free. It is well designed, but the performance is a bit sluggish. The data
    available is predominantly for matches, I will re-use some of it, and blend
    it with my own API.🍹</p>
<h2 class="world-cup">Finished Application</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://worldcup-nirvana.herokuapp.com/">try it!</a></p>
<p>It is hosted on heroku using a free account. The website sleeps
after 30 minutes of inactivity. <i class="em-svg em-female_zombie"
></i> So, it may take 2 minutes for the website to appear for you! Of course,
when you pay for full account services, everything
will work at light speed.<i class="em-svg em-money_mouth_face"></i></p>

<h2 class="world-cup">Design</h2>
<p>TODO: INCLUDE DESIGN LATER!</p>
<h3 class="world-cup">Dream Team</h2>
I made a prototype for making a dream team as I wanted to experiment with some variations
of the layout to find a good balance between the style and functionality.
