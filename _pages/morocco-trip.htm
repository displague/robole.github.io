Helmet blew off on the suspension bridge at the highest point at the end of the gorge, wild wind. Took a long time to find accomodation in Alora, had to navigate the very narrow, cramped streets. The geography is strange, there is an upper and lower side of the town split by the river. The hotel was in an industrial estate favoured by bikers, there was a party on, with some drunk patrons at 8pm.</td>

Immigration with passport handled on ferry, I waited towards end of journey to present my passport, offical spent some time trying to locate a place to stamp. Hustlers at port. Couldnt shirk my &quot;guide&quot; (Rudani) to find the hostel, took me to a tourist trap restaurant trying to charge me 15euro for a basic typical meal that would be 4euro max. Very awkward to back out. Gave kid some small euro coins and he was exasperated but refused to listen that I didnt have money. Nice hostel with eceletic mix of backpackers.  Couldn&#39;t withdraw cash from 2 ATMs with debit card. </td>

Had coffee in small plaza, and local guy asked to sit with me, quickly became apparent he was the infamous con-artist Richard who poses as an artist, there was a notice about him in the hostel! An American guy I spoked to at breakfast stopped to chat, and discretely brought this up to me to ensure I was aware of his identity. Folllowed by kids to Ibn Battouta&#39;s tomb, wanted money in the beginning but when I was playful they wanted to look me up on facebook!</td>

<td>Was searching for a place for breakfast and reluctantly followed the advice of a local alcoholic, he brought me in and I had bisara and mint tea. Very hectic train journey, found a seat when we were closer to Marrakech. Not many buses along the main throughfare towards medina, no busstops! Asked local guy at first bus top, what number I could get to main plaza, he said 3 but none came. Kept walking. Got hassled by really beligerent kid when looking for a hostel and had to step inside a hostel. Worker offered me mint tea and offered me a private room, I declined, and he gave me directions to another hostel. Got dinner in the square, measly portion of food, and guys charge for side dishes (olives, bread, tomatoe dip). Had to show him I didnt touch the tomato dip to avoid paying. Nice hostel but zero noise isolation with open central chamber trough building, didnt sleep well. </td>

<td>Got the bus most of the way to street with a cluster of rental car agencies. Eventually got a deal with Medloc, should have haggled more but was relieved in the end that there was enough on my credit card to take the deposit. But I needed cash and would need to use my debit card, and am now in a risky spot where maybe I cant find a bank to withdraw cash. Went to the train station to try ATMs there. Parked in dropoff zone. Managed to get cash. When I reached the car, a policeman walked over and gave me abuse. He was wearing braces and was spitting in my face while speaking. He told me I was lucky that I was not towed and was extemely determined to tell me how wrong I was! I managed to get away! Traffic subsided quickly when on the city limits and was calmer than I expected.</td>

Complexion of countryside transformed. Heavy rain at lower altitudes. Got some food at truck stop. Arrived back at car rental company 4 hours late. Parking attendant called the company for me, and employee offered to drive me to my hotel, momentarily I thought he was going to try to bring me to a friend&#39;s hotel when initially extending the offer.</td>

Manager appeared and would only offer me a 2-bed room, which I reluctantly took. He was drinking from a nescafe jar and wore a beret and spoke french with a parisan flair. Very different vibe.</td>

<h2>Things that are absent, or not that apparent from guidebooks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How relentless Morrocans are when it comes to getting money from you
    somehow. People will follow you trying to be a guide, outright con-artists,
    salesmen, and beggars. It's hard to have a peaceful time walking around,
    but if you are good-natured about it, some will switch and have a regular
    conversation. Other times, you may pay a small amount to be left in peace!</li>
    <li>Reviews of accomodation are overwhelming positive. Generally, Moroccan
      staff are extremely friendly and the old buildings are beautiful, this
      skews people's feedback and can be misleading. Especially in Marrakech,
    which seems to be where most people begin their trip. Prices are negotiable.</li>
    <li>No idea how to get a shared cab, couldn't get a fair price when getting
      a cab. Not many bus-stops or information how to use local transport!</li>
      <li>Train service is good. Ticket machines in station tend to breakdown
        a lot. Some routes are busier than others and you should try to
        board early, seating is not assigned in second class.</li>
        <li>Difficult to pay local prices in restaurants. Not everywhere has
          menus, and if they do, prices are higher for the english menus.
          Speaking a bit more French can help to combat this by asking for
          prices before ordering.</li>
          <li>YHA hostels in Casablanca and Rabat are not on internet</li>
          <li>Trustworthiness of local car rental agencies is hard to verify
            online. I got a brand new car from Medloc and it was a
            straightforward transaction. I was able to drop the car back out of
            office hours, and the staff member dropped me off as well!</li>
          <li>Driving to Dades Gorge, I had no idea how far I had to go to
            see the most deepest, most dramatic vista of the gorge.</li>
          <li>Kasbah Amridil has a fake entrance (it is mentioned in the Lonely
            Planet).</li>
            <li>Price guide for each city would help to see differences. Always
            cheaper away from tourist hotspots (medinas).</li>
    </ul>
