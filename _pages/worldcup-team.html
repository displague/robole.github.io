<h1 class="world-cup">World Cup Team Selection</h1>
<p>I wanted to create a cool interface to allow people to play
  as a virtual manager, and select their own line-up for the teams
  in the Fifa World Cup 2018.</p>

<p>The interface used in fantasy football leagues,usually displays
  the player as the team jersey with a name
  underneath. In newspapers articles, the players are usually displayed as
  a circle with a name underneath. Instead, I wanted to use a portrait
  of a player and give some stats as you pick.</p>

<p>On hover, you are given some stats of the player. Double-clicking the
  position will allow you to select a player from the pop-out tray.</p>
