<h1 class="world-cup">World Cup Team Selection</h1>
<h2 class="world-cup">Objective</h2>
<p>I wanted to create an appealing, responsive interface to allow
  people to display, explore and select the line-ups for the
  teams in the Fifa World Cup 2018. </p>

<h2 class="world-cup">Visual Design</h2>
<p>I wanted to make a depature from the typical formats. The
  interface used in fantasy football leagues, usually displays
  the player as the team jersey with their surname underneath.</p>

<br/>
<p>In newspaper articles, it is popular to make a simple graphic to show the lineup,
  players are displayed as a shape (typically a circle) with their surname underneath.</p>

<p>Instead, I wanted to use a portrait of a player, have the full name in a
  caption underneath, and give some stats that extend from this caption when
  hovered over. Not revolutionary, but it looks better to me! On mobile, the
  portrait can be reduced in size, and the name can be changed to be the
  surname only, or can be hidden, depending on the space.</p>

<h3 class="world-cup">Player Selection</h3>

 <p>Also, I wantd to tweak how players are selected or swapped. Double-clicking
   will trigger a selection or change, the position is highlighted, a drawer
   will slide in from the right, offering the alternative players that can be selected
   for that position. More economic use of screen real estate than in Fantasy
   Football. For mobile, the drawer will take up the entire screen with a close
   button.</p>
