<h1>World Cup Team Selection</h1>
<p>I wanted to create a cool interface to allow people to be a
  virtual manager, and select their preferred line-up for the
  World Cup 2018.</p>

<p>A similar interface is used in fantasy football leagues, which
  usually displays the player as the team jersey with a name
  underneath. In newspapers, the players are usually displayed as a circle with a
name underneath. Instead, I wanted to use a portrait of a player and
give some stats as you pick.</p>

<p>On hover, you are given some stats of the player. Double-clicking the
  position will allow you to select a player from the pop-out tray.</p>
