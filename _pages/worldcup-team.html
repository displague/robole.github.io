<h1 class="world-cup">World Cup Team Selection</h1>
<p>I wanted to create a cool interface to allow people to play
  as a virtual manager, and select their own line-up for the teams
  in the Fifa World Cup 2018.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a depature for the typical formats. The
  interface used in fantasy football leagues, usually displays
  the player as the team jersey with a name underneath. In newspaper
  articles, there is a simple graphic with players are
   displayed as a circle with a name underneath. Instead, I wanted
   to use a portrait of a player and give some stats as you pick.</p>

<p>On hover, you are given stats of the player. Double-clicking the
  position will allow you to select a player from a pop-out tray.</p>
