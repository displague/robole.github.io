  <h1>Frequency Punchcard</h1>
  <p>A Frequency Punchcard is a grid with sized circles showing the
    frequency of an event.</p>
  <p>It provides insight for planning, allowing someone to explore
    an overview of the schedule of an event when making a
    decision. It is used often for transport schedules to explore
    timetables.</p>
  <p>You can find the specifications and code in this
    <a href="https://github.com/robole/d3-frequency-punchcard">github repository</a>.</p>
