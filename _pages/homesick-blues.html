<h1>Subterranean Homesick Blues</h1>
<p>Looking at the intersection of art, revolution, pop culture, and technology.
  Are they antagonistic? Together can they provoke and stimulate positive
  change? Bob Dylan crossed these borders throughout his career, and became a
  reluctant figure in the anti-war movement, so was an ideal subject
  to explore this idea.</p>
  <p>The idea was to recreate his video for Subterranean Homesick Blues, but
    use what looks like an oil-painting to create an animation. I wanted the
    animation to look incongruent, for it to look
    a bit realistic, yet be a bit of a misrepresentation. Isn't this how the world
  is often? Portrayal and reality can be indistinguishable. We want to remove
the rough aspects, and give everything a smooth view.</p>
