  <h2>Things that are absent, or not that apparent from guidebooks</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>How relentless Morrocans are when it comes to getting money from you
      somehow. People will follow you trying to be a guide, outright con-artists,
      salesmen, and beggars. It's hard to have a peaceful time walking around,
      but if you are good-natured about it, some will switch and have a regular
      conversation. Other times, you may pay a small amount to be left in peace!</li>
    <li>Reviews of accomodation are overwhelming positive. Generally, Moroccan
        staff are extremely friendly and the old buildings are beautiful, this
        skews people's feedback and can be misleading. Especially in Marrakech,
      which seems to be where most people begin their trip. The hostel I was in
      for 1 night in Marrakech was noisy and had 2 bathrooms for a lot of
      guests, this was not mentioned in any reviews. Prices are negotiable
      most of the time.</li>
    <li>No idea how to get a shared cab, couldn't get a fair price when getting
        a cab. Not many bus-stops or information how to use local transport!</li>
        <li>Train service is good. Ticket machines in station tend to breakdown
          a lot. Some routes are busier than others and you should try to
          board early, seating is not assigned in second class.</li>
          <li>Difficult to pay local prices in restaurants. Not everywhere has
            menus, and if they do, prices are higher for the english menus.
            Speaking a bit more French can help to combat this by asking for
            prices before ordering.</li>
            <li>YHA hostels in Casablanca and Rabat are not on internet</li>
            <li>Trustworthiness of local car rental agencies is hard to verify
              online. I got a brand new car from Medloc and it was a
              straightforward transaction, and was 40% cheaper than the
              international companies. I was able to drop the car back out of
              office hours, and the staff member dropped me to my hotel
              as well!</li>
            <li>Driving to Dades Gorge, I had no idea how far I had to go to
              see the deepest, most dramatic vista of the gorge.</li>
            <li>Kasbah Amridil has a fake counterpart, they built a new kasbah
              right next to the original to look similar, and they charge more.
              On arrival, staff will persaude you to come into the fake! This is
              mentioned in the Lonely Planet, but I didn't know about it until I
              arrived, and was fortunate to find the real one when I was walking
              around ignoring the men asking me to come in!</li>
              <li>A price guide for restraurants would be helpful. There are
                always cheaper away from tourist hotspots (medinas), and often
                food is tastier and more authentic.</li>
                <li>It would be great to have a collection of photos for each
                  attraction and the city to decide where to visit. This would
                  have been helpful in choosing between the movie studios in
                  Ouarzazate, I didn't have time to go to both.</li>
                <li>Marrakech airport is very modern and pleasant, but it takes
                  some time to get to departure gate because:
                  <ul>
                  <li>You must show passport and have luggage scanned at entrance
                    to terminal building</li>
                    <li>It was required by TAP Airlines to verify your credit
                      card in person. So I had to go to another desk to do this,
                       and then return to the checkin desk. Even if you check
                       in online, you need to go to the desk to verify your
                       carry-on luggage to proceed through security.</li>
                  <li>It's not possible to exchange Moroccan Dhirams outside of
                    the country. So, you need to exchange your leftover currency
                    before going to security</li>
                    <li>Standard security screening, and passport control before
                      you reach the departure gates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
      </ol>
