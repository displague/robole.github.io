  <h1>Distance Table</h1>
  <p>A distance table shows a list of cities and the distances between them.
    These tables are used often in road maps for trip planning.</p>
  <p>This implementation only shows the values once as the relationships are
    symmetrical i.e. the distance from New York to Boston is the same
    distance from Boston to New York! So, the table is deformed to a
    tiered version to avoid repeating the values for both directions.</p>
  <p>The distance table can be used to show other optional fields, this
    is useful if you want to compare bus frequencies, journey times per
    transport mode between cities to make a decision on travel arrangements.</p>
    <p>You can find the specifications and code in this
