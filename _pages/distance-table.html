  <h1>Distance Table</h1>
  <p>A distance table shows the distances between a list of cities, groundbreaking huh?
    Not really! These tables are used often in road maps for trip planning, but
    I've not seen a dynamic version.</p>
    <p> I have extended the table so you can include used-defined fields, to give the
    opportunity for making better comparsions. For instance, maybe you you want to
    compare transport modes for a route, then you include the journey times for
    each transport mode. Simple enough.</p>
  <p>This implementation only shows the values once as the relationships are
    symmetrical i.e. the distance from New York to Boston is the same
    distance from Boston to New York! So, the table is deformed to a
    tiered version to avoid repeating the values for both directions.</p>
    <p>You can find the specifications and code in this
